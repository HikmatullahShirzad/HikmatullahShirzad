<p><span>This chocolate chip cookie recipe has been passed down through generations in our family, starting with my grandmother, who baked them during the holidays for her children. Over time, each family member has added their own touch to make them unique, but the essence of the recipe remains the same: a comforting balance of gooey chocolate, buttery richness, and a hint of vanilla. These cookies were always the centerpiece at family gatherings, and their aroma is forever tied to memories of laughter and togetherness.</span></p>

<p><strong><q>This recipe isn’t just about cookies—it’s about love baked into every bite, the kind that brings the whole family together,</q> my grandmother always said as she pulled a warm batch from the oven.</strong></p>

 

<p>Here are some tips on how to not mess this recipe and  make it just the way we have done it for 3 generations.</p>


<p>Tip:
Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat or in the microwave in short intervals, stirring frequently. Once it's fully melted, let it cool for about 10–15 minutes at room temperature. The goal is to have the butter still liquid but not hot—slightly warm or room temperature.</p>

<p>Why:
If the butter is too hot, it can dissolve the sugar too quickly, leading to a denser, greasy cookie instead of a soft and chewy texture. Cooling the butter ensures that it mixes smoothly with the sugars without affecting the dough's consistency.</p>

        <h1><ul> The Instructions</h1></ul>
<p><strong>1:Whisk the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.
</p></strong>


<p><strong>2:In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together until no brown sugar lumps remain. Whisk in the egg and egg yolk. Finally, whisk in the vanilla extract. The mixture will be thin. Pour into dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft, thick, and appear greasy. Fold in the chocolate chips. The chocolate chips may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine them.
</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>3:Cover the dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2–3 hours or up to 3 days. I highly recommend chilling the cookie dough overnight for less spreading.</p>
</strong>
<p><strong>4:Take the dough out of the refrigerator and allow it to slightly soften at room temperature for 10 minutes.
</p></strong>
<p>
<strong>5:Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.

</p></strong>

<p>
<strong>6:Using a cookie scoop or Tablespoon measuring spoon, measure 3 scant Tablespoons (about 2 ounces, or 60g) of dough for XL cookies or 2 heaping Tablespoons (about 1.75 ounces, or 50g) of dough for medium/large cookies. Roll into a ball, making sure the shape is taller rather than wide—almost like a cylinder. This helps the cookies bake up thicker. Repeat with remaining dough. Place 8–9 balls of dough onto each cookie sheet. </p>
<p>
</strong>
<strong>7:Bake the cookies for 12–13 minutes or until the edges are very lightly browned. (XL cookies can take closer to 14 minutes.) The centers will look very soft, but the cookies will continue to set as they cool. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, press a few extra chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies. This is optional and only for looks. After 10 minutes of cooling on the baking sheets, transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. 
</p></strong>
<p>
<strong>8:Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.
</p>
